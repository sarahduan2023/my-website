        <h1>Sarah Duan</h1>
        <p><strong>Computer Science Enthusiast</strong></p>
        <p>I’m Sarah Duan. I immigrated to Canada with my family at a young age and grew up there. My drive comes from a deep sense of curiosity, a love for innovation, and a strong desire to make a positive impact. I’m passionate about exploring the exciting world of technology, sharing insights, and inspiring others to chase their dreams. Together, we can help shape the future.</p>
        <p>My main focus is applying machine learning and AI systems to cancer care and medical environments. I'm currently exploring cutting-edge use cases at the intersection of AI, oncology, and mathematics.</p>
        <p>Outside of work and research, I’m an outdoor enthusiast who enjoys surfing, rock climbing, cycling, running, and fitness. I also love diving into philosophy and math. If you’re into those things too, let’s connect and explore how we can make a positive difference in the world together.</p>
        <p>Stay curious, keep learning, and never stop pushing your boundaries. I’m also active on GitHub, where I’ve contributed to projects related to healthcare applications. I enjoy tackling challenging tech problems and working with amazing teams. If you’re looking for ways to collaborate, feel free to reach out—I’d love to connect!</p>
